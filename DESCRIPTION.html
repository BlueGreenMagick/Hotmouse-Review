Use <b>mouse shortcuts</b> to review easily and quickly!

<b>Scroll down</b> to <i>show answer</i> and answer <i>good</i>, <b>scroll up</b> to answer 'again'.

With 144 possible hotkey combinations and 22 possible actions, you can customize the shortcuts however you want!

<h2>How to use</h2>

A hotmouse only works when in review mode. You can set different shortcuts for frontside and backside of a card.

By default, the hotmouses are configured as below. You can change them in the add-on config.

right click: undo <br>
scroll down (front): show answer <br>
scroll up (back): again <br>
scroll down (back): good <br>
middle button + scroll up (back): hard <br>
middle button + scroll down (back): easy <br>
left click + right click (left click first): disable hotkey

<h2>How It Works & Customizing Hotkeys</h2>

A hotkey is comprised of mouse press and mouse wheel events.

When you press a mouse button, the add-on searches for a hotkey where all the buttons you pressed beforehand are
written as 'press [button name]' and the last button you pressed as 'click [button name]'.
The same thing happens when you scroll: it searches for a hotkey where all the buttons that are being pressed
are written as 'press [button name]' and the scroll direction as 'wheel [direction]'.
If such hotkey exists, its corresponding action is executed.

<h2>Notes</h2>
If you have many long cards that require scrolling, having scroll hotkeys will not let you scroll your card
unless you turn off the add-on. (Left click + Right click by default)

You will not be able to access the context menu while reviewing unless you turn off the add-on.
